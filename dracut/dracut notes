To create a initramfs image, the most simple command is:
# dracut
# dracut --force

Inspecting the Contents
To see the contents of the image created by dracut, you can use the lsinitrd tool.
# lsinitrd | less
To display the contents of a file in the initramfs also use the lsinitrd tool:
# lsinitrd -f /etc/ld.so.conf
include ld.so.conf.d/*.conf

To see a list of available dracut modules, use the --list-modules option:
# dracut --list-modules

Some dracut modules are turned off by default and have to be activated manually. 
You can do this by adding the dracut modules to the configuration file /etc/dracut.conf or /etc/dracut.conf.d/myconf.conf

To get a quick start for the suitable kernel command line on your system, use the --print-cmdline option:
# dracut --print-cmdline

Injecting custom Files
To add your own files to the initramfs image, you have several possibilities.
The --include option let you specify a source path and a target path. For example
# dracut --include cmdline-preset /etc/cmdline.d/mycmdline.conf initramfs-cmdline-pre.img
will create an initramfs image, where the file cmdline-preset will be copied inside the initramfs to /etc/cmdline.d/mycmdline.conf. --include can only be specified once.

The --install option let you specify several files, which will get installed in the initramfs image at the same location, as they are present on initramfs creation time.
# dracut --install 'strace fsck.ext3 ssh' initramfs-dbg.img

Identifying your problem area
Remove 'rhgb' and 'quiet' from the kernel command line
Add 'rd.shell' to the kernel command line. This will present a shell should dracut be unable to locate your root device
Add 'rd.shell rd.debug log_buf_len=1M' to the kernel command line so that dracut shell commands are printed as they are executed
The file /run/initramfs/rdsosreport.txt is generated, which contains all the logs and the output of all significant tools, which are mentioned later.
If you want to save that output, simply mount /boot by hand or insert an USB stick and mount that. Then you can store the output for later inspection.

Debugging dracut on shutdown
To debug the shutdown sequence on systemd systems, you can rd.break on pre-shutdown or shutdown.
To do this from an already booted system:
# mkdir -p /run/initramfs/etc/cmdline.d
# echo "rd.debug rd.break=pre-shutdown rd.break=shutdown" > /run/initramfs/etc/cmdline.d/debug.conf
# touch /run/initramfs/.need_shutdown
This will give you a dracut shell after the system pivotâ€™ed back in the initramfs.
